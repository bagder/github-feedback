# Mark conflicting PRs in the list

It would be neat with some sort of symbol/marking in the PR list to show PRs that conflict or otherwise can't get merged cleanly as-is. We could use that as a signal that the PR is not interesting right now or to ask the author to fix the conflicts and push an update etc.
