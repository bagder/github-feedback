# Larger list of CI jobs

When a pull-request is filed, there's a small list of CI jobs shown in the PR/commit. It shows 5-6 job lines in a fixed size frame with a scrollbar to view the rest. It requires a lot of scrolling and very annoyingly it **changes order on updates** which is highly frustrating and requires even more scrolling. In our project we typically have at least 50 such lines (and we would easily have the doubled amount if all our CI jobs were listed individually). It'd help if that window could be made larger.
