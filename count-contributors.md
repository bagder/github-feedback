# Count contributors properly

The "contributors" view  doesn't include all authors. Like for example users without GitHub accounts are not included in the count which makes it <em>grossly</em> misleading. In curl we have ~30% more contributors than GitHub says we do. That's in the order of several hundred additional contributors that GitHub pretends don't exist. For no good reason.
