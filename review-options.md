# More review options besides "Approve" and "Request Changes"

There should be a review option that's somewhere in between "Approve" and "Request changes", like "Approve pending changes" or "Don't block on this, but x, y, and z would be really nice tweaks here, and it'd be really swell if you thought so too" or something along those lines. I guess one could just say that that's what just leaving a plain comment is for, but I want the system to automatically change the review status to "Approved" for me once the changes are accepted.
