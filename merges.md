# A "merges" keyword

It could work similar to the magic `closes #NNN` and `fixes #NNN` keywords when a commit is pushed. To enable later searching for pull-requests (PRs) that were merged/not merged - and the PR could also possibly mention which branch it went into. Since we almost always edit and merge PRs directly in git, without using GitHub (see issue [8] below), virtually all PRs are just "closed by [commit]" when viewed on GitHub. Which isn't ideal, as they can also be closed for other reasons. Users are also often confused when their pull-requests are marked "closed" and not "merged" when they in fact were merged.
